## Hi there 👋

**wesleyfranks/wesleyfranks** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on SkillMapMentor
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Development with RoadMap.sh
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with an opensource project 
- 💬 Ask me about my dog Jarvis 🐶
- 🪭 Fan of Marvel, DC, comics, and DBZ. 
- 📫 How to reach me: @wesleyfranks on X.com (twitter)
- ⚡  Fun fact: I went to 3 different states once before joining the Army. During that trip I just happen to meet my grandma in those 3 states and it was not preplanned at all. It just happened. Texas, Illinios, and Arizona.
